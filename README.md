# CardiYo
Repository for F29SO coursework. 

To design a prototype web-app for Cardi-Yo!, an app that allows users to visualise their distance walked, jogged, run, hiked, etc, via reflections of famous mountains in the real world. Through this, users can track progress and gain medals and trophies upon completion. Users can also communicate with their healthcare provider as they assign goals to better their fitness and health journey. 

Future implementations would involve friendship circles, which allow users to interact in friendly rivalry with their friends, and global events, where users can participate in races or marathons across the world.
